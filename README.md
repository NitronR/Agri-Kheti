Problem to be resolved: Small scale farmers sell their crops to wholesalers at very low cost (lower than Minimim Support Price) due to lack of knowledge.

Solution:

A web application that can be used by farmers to sell their crops to the highest bidder. The minimum bid will start at the Minimum Support price.

Due to unavailability of devices to access the web application in case of small scale farmers, an SMS service is integrated in the web server so that farmers can access all the features of the project through the SMS service. This helps as majority of farmers have an SMS enabled phone (even the one with keypad).

What a farmer can do:
 - The SMS service can be used to add a post about the type and quantity of yield.
 - The farmer will get alerts about latest bids and the final bid.
 - The farmer will get contact information of the buyer to sell his produce.
